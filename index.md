I am a second-year PhD student in mathematics at the [University of Notre Dame](https://math.nd.edu/). My research focuses on category theory, topology, and a bunch of other stuff. My advisors are [Stephan Stolz](https://www3.nd.edu/~stolz/) and [Christopher Schommer-Pries](https://sites.nd.edu/chris-schommer-pries/?utm_campaign=redirect&utm_medium=web&utm_source=blogs.nd.edu).
