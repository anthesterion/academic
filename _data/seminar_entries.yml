# - {title: 'Analysis of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation', abstract: 'The KdV equation is one of the most ubiquitous models in mathematics and physics. It was first derived by Boussinesq in 1877 in his effort to demystify Russell's observation of what he called the "great wave of translation" in a Union Canal near Edinburgh in 1834. Korteweg and de Vries rediscovered the KdV equation in 1895 and confirmed that it has traveling wave solutions (solitons). The solving of the KdV initial value problem, with nice data, was initiated by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura in 1967 by recognizing its remarkable integrability properties. Its solving for rough ($L^2$) data was accomplished by Bourgain in 1993 using novel ideas from classical and harmonic analysis. In 1996, Kenig, Ponce, and Vega advanced these ideas and solved the KdV with data of regularity below $L^2$. It is interesting that these ideas are also needed if one studies KdV solutions with the nicest possible data (analytic).

- {title: 'You could have formulated the Cobordism Hypothesis', abstract: 'In this talk we will try to study manifolds in their totality: all $n$-manifolds, or all manifolds up to a fixed dimension, or all manifolds equipped with a certain structure. It turns out that these collections form specific algebraic structures that are fully characterized by the Cobordism Hypothesis, formulated by Baez-Dolan and proven by Lurie. In particular, we will talk about building manifolds by inductively gluing cobordisms, some category theory, and the algebraic restrictions imposed by a topological field theory, which is a representation of such an "algebra of manifolds".'}

- {title: 'On the Fukaya-Morse A-infinity category', abstract: 'I will sketch the construction of the Fukaya-Morse category of a Riemannian manifold X -- an A-infinity category (a category where associativity of composition holds only "up-to-homotopy") where the higher composition maps are given in terms of numbers of embedded trees in X, with edges following the gradient trajectories of certain Morse functions. I will give simple examples and explain different approaches to understanding the structure and proving the quadratic relations on the structure maps -- (1a) via homotopy transfer, (1b) effective field theory approach, (2) topological quantum mechanics approach. (Maybe a subset of this, depending on time.) The talk is based on a joint work with O. Chekeres, A. Losev and D. Youmans, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12756" target=_blank>arXiv:2112.12756</a>.'}
- {title: 'o-minimal method and generalized sum-product phenomena', abstract: 'I will discuss a joint work with Yifan Jing and Souktik Roy where we show that for a bivariate polynomial $P(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}[x,y] \setminus (\mathbb{R}[x] \cup \mathbb{R}[y])$ to exhibit small expansion on a finite set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, we must have $$ P(x,y) = f(\gamma u(x) + \delta u(y)) \text{ or } P(x,y) = f(u^m(x) u^n(y)) $$ for some univariate $f, g, u \in \mathbb{R}[t] \setminus \mathbb{R}$, constants $\gamma, \delta \in \mathbb{R}^{\neq 0}$, and $m, n \in \mathbb{N}^{\geq 1}$. This yields an Elekes-Ronyai type structural result for symmetric nonexpanders, resolving a question mentioned by de Zeeuw. Our result uses o-minimal/semi-algebro-geometric techniques to replace algebraic geometric techniques, which are only applicable to more special cases.'}
