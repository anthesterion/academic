- {name: 'Lorenzo Riva', affiliation: 'Notre Dame', title: 'You could have formulated the Cobordism Hypothesis', date: 'Jan. 27', abstract: 'In this talk we will try to study manifolds in their totality: all $n$-manifolds, or all manifolds up to a fixed dimension, or all manifolds equipped with a certain structure. It turns out that these collections form specific algebraic structures that are fully characterized by the Cobordism Hypothesis, formulated by Baez-Dolan and proven by Lurie. In particular, we will talk about building manifolds by inductively gluing cobordisms, some category theory, and the algebraic restrictions imposed by a topological field theory, which is a representation of such an "algebra of manifolds".'}
