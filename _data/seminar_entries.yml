It turns out that these collections form specific algebraic structures that are fully characterized by the Cobordism Hypothesis, formulated by Baez-Dolan and proven by Lurie. In particular, we will talk about building manifolds by inductively gluing cobordisms, some category theory, and the algebraic restrictions imposed by a topological field theory, which is a representation of such an "algebra of manifolds".'}

- {name: 'Minh Chieu Tran', affiliation: 'Notre Dame', title: 'o-minimal method and generalized sum-product phenomena', date: 'Feb. 24', abstract: 'I will discuss a joint work with Yifan Jing and Souktik Roy where we show that for a bivariate polynomial $P(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}[x,y] \setminus (\mathbb{R}[x] \cup \mathbb{R}[y])$ to exhibit small expansion on a finite set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, we must have $$ P(x,y) = f(\gamma u(x) + \delta u(y)) \text{ or } P(x,y) = f(u^m(x) u^n(y)) $$ for some univariate $f, g, u \in \mathbb{R}[t] \setminus \mathbb{R}$, constants $\gamma, \delta \in \mathbb{R}^{\neq 0}$, and $m, n \in \mathbb{N}^{\geq 1}$. This yields an Elekes-Ronyai type structural result for symmetric nonexpanders, resolving a question mentioned by de Zeeuw. Our result uses o-minimal/semi-algebro-geometric techniques to replace algebraic geometric techniques, which are only applicable to more special cases.'}
